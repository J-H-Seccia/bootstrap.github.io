        <h1>Why Bootstrap?</h1>

            <section>

                <h2>Time-saving</h2>

                <p>Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are crucial. But once you have a general understanding of these, you can utilize Bootstrap to save you from spending hours on repetitive simple tasks.</p>
                <p>With Bootstrap, you do not need to start your project from scratch. Instead, there are many components and classes that come pre-designed and ready to use.</p>

                <h2>Easy & Responsive</h2>

                <p>Bootstrap is a beginner-friendly framework. You don't even need to understand how CSS flexbox or CSS grid work in order to create something like a column layout in your webpage. To make it even easier, with the bootstrap grid system your layout will adjust automatically to whichever screen size you are using.</p>

                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                
                <p>Understanding the importance of everyone having access to websites, Bootstrap prioritizes accessibility attributes such as keyboard navigation and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).</p>

                <p>
                    Customizing Bootstrap is easy. Once you have taken advantage of using Bootstrap's pre-designed layouts and components, you can simply make modifications to them to make the design unique for your website.
